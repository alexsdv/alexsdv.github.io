						<div class="faq-answer-item">
							<span class="faq-question">Unable to accept my payment. Why?</span>
							<span class="faq-content">
								<p>When your payment is not going through it may be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>
										1. You recently made a purchase but have not spent any credits since. The system will prevent you from making an additional purchase in order to prevent multiple transactions made in error.
										<p>As an alternative, you may purchase larger credit packages which will save you from topping up so often.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										2. Your bank is blocking the transaction.
										<p>AmoLatina is part of Anastasia International, an international company that employs a number of payment merchants worldwide.</p>
										<p>Some banks may require additional verification from the account holder when they see an international transaction.</p>
										<p>When a transaction is declined by a member’s bank, AmoLatina does not hold any of the funds. You may however see the declined transaction as pending and it will be released to your account depending on the internal policies of your bank.</p>
										<p>Please contact your bank in order to authorize all further payments to AmoLatina, part of Anastasia International. You will then be able to make a purchase on our website.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										3. Additional verification is required by AmoLatina.
										<p>We work very hard to protect our members from fraudulent activity and as a safeguard may conduct checks on payments and transactions made on our website.</p>
										<p>Please contact our Customer Support team who will look into the details of your purchase history and provide you with an explanation.</p>

								<p>The standard membership renewal rate is $9.99, and this is the amount that it will cost to renew your membership after the first month.</p>
								<p>Upon subscribing we invite our members to review the Terms and Conditions of our monthly membership program. (link to the article)</p>

						<div class="faq-answer-item">
							<span class="faq-question">Why I was charged  $15.99</span>
							<span class="faq-content">
								<p>$15.99 is the cost of 20 credits on AmoLatina.</p>

								<p>Upon subscribing we invite our members to review the Terms and Conditions of our monthly membership program. (link to the article) Automatic top-up of 20 credits is initially set up on your account when you subscribe.</p>

								<p>Automatic Purchasing is our option that allows you to stay in touch with the lady, even when your credits run out in the middle of Live Chat or Camshare. It automatically purchases additional credits, required to continue the communication, so that your romantic conversation won't suddenly be cut off because you lack a few credits.</p>
								<p><img src="img/subscribe_get_amaz.png" alt=""></p>
								<p>However, you have always have the option to disable it by unchecking the box "Allow Automatic Purchasing" in the "My settings and Password" menu and then by pressing the "Save" button.</p>

								<p><img src="img/services_callme.png" alt=""></p>
								<p>You need to select your time zone, the date and time you wish to speak with your lady.</p>

								<p><img src="img/phone_reser.png" alt=""></p>
								<p><img src="img/base_price.png" alt=""></p>
								<p>It is also very important that you have the correct contact number indicated in the corresponding fields.</p>

								<p>Kindly check the country code (for example, 1 for the USA, 44 for the UK etc.), your area code (3 digits only in this field) and your telephone number.  You may also indicate an additional number we will be able to connect you on in the event that the primary phone number is unreachable.</p>

								<p>Please ensure that you have at least 100 credits in your account as otherwise you will not be able to place the reservation (with the exception of a repeat call to the lady that is charged 70 credits).</p>

								<p>The lady’s time will be set automatically depending on her location and you will be able to review it and set the most convenient time to suit you both.</p>

								<p>The system will notify you that 100 credits will be deducted from your account for the first 10 minutes. Please note that each additional minute costs 10 credits, therefore if you wish to speak with your lady for longer than 10 minutes, it is always a good idea to top-up before the call takes place.</p>

								<p>The lady will now receive a notification and will have the option to accept the time you suggested or offer a new one.</p>

								<p>You will be notified in both cases- if the lady accepts your time or proposes a new one. If she proposes a new one, you can only accept it or cancel the call and place a new reservation.</p>

								<p>You will receive a call at the appointed time; the system will automatically connect you with your lady and the interpreter.</p>

								<p>If there is an issue and either one of the parties is unable to accept the call and call back within 15 minutes, the deposit will be refunded to your account. Please check your Purchase Credits section, tab History for confirmation.</p>

								<p>If you do not see the call in the list as the status Lady proposed a new time or Awaiting appointed time, something went not as expected and you will need to place the reservation again.</p>

								<p>This happens when a lady suggests a different time and you do not accept it in time before a call is due to take place or if the time was set incorrectly and you did not pick it up when the phone rang.</p>

								<p>You will be able to click on Archived Phone Calls and see the status of the call. We will be happy to look into it for you to find out exactly what went wrong. Please contact our Customer Support team with your ID and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

						<div class="faq-answer-item">
							<span class="faq-question">Why can't the lady see me?</span>
							<span class="faq-content">
								<p>One possible reason for the lack of signal from your camera is that there is another program already using your webcam while you are trying to use Camshare. Please try closing down all other programs apart from your browser and see if that helps.</p>

								<p>Please be aware that our Camshare service requires a high-speed internet connection on both yours and the lady's end in order for you to see her large, HD video feed. If the lady does not have a good internet connection, she may not be able to see your video.</p>

								<p>Please also check that you have the latest version of Adobe Flash Player as this is required for all our video-related services.</p>

								<p>As well as the aforementioned software requirements, please ensure you camera is powered on and that you have enabled your video feed by clicking on the camera button at the bottom of the chat window. If you do not see this 'allow' button then please change your screen resolution to a number higher than 900.</p>

								<p>Please make sure your camera is not being used by any other program, such as Skype as there is a flash feature that prevents multiple applications from accessing your webcam simultaneously. Please completely shut down any other applications that employ your webcam before attempting your next Camshare.</p>
 
 								<p>It is also important to make a distinction between Live Chat with video and Camshare. All  your current sessions in Live Chat have to be shut down before starting a Camshare, these are two different services and cannot run side by side.</p>
