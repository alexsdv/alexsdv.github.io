							<!-- QUESTION -->
							<div class="faq-question-block">
								<span class="faq-question">Unable to accept my payment. Why?</span>
								<span class="faq-answer">
									<p>When your payment is not going through it may be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>1. Your bank is blocking the transaction. 
											AmoLatina is an international company that employs a number of payment merchants worldwide.</p>
											<p>Some banks may require additional verification from the account holder when they see an international transaction.</p>
											<p>When a transaction is declined by a member's bank,  AmoLatina does not hold any of the funds. You may however see the declined transaction as pending and it will be released to your account depending on the internal policies of your bank.</p>
											<p>Please contact your bank in order to authorize all further payments to AmoLatina. You will then be able to make a purchase on our website.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>2. You recently made a purchase but have not spent any credits since. The system will prevent you from making an additional purchase in order to prevent multiple transactions made in error.</p>
											<p>Once you are able to make purchases, as an alternative, you may purchase larger credit packages which will save you from topping up so often.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>3. Additional verification is required by AmoLatina.</p>
											<p>We work very hard to protect our members from fraudulent activity and as a safeguard may conduct checks on payments and transactions made on our website.</p> 
											<p>Please contact our Customer Support team who will look into the details of your purchase history and provide you with an explanation.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>4. If you are having issues with PayPal they are usually caused by an authorization issue from PayPal side. If you receive the following error code, please, contact PayPal Customer Service to receive assistance.</p>

								<span class="faq-question">What is a payment of $9.99</span>
								<span class="faq-answer">
									<p>The standard membership renewal rate is $9.99, and this is the amount that it will cost to renew your membership after the first month.</p>
									<p>Upon subscribing we invite our members to review the <a href="http://www.amolatina.com/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a> of our monthly membership program.</p><br/>

							<!-- QUESTION -->
							<div class="faq-question-block">
								<span class="faq-question">Why I was charged  $15.99?</span>
								<span class="faq-answer">
									<p>$15.99 is the cost of 20 credits on AmoLatina.</p>
									<p>Upon subscribing we invite our members to review the <a href="http://www.amolatina.com/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a> of our monthly membership program. Automatic top-up of 20 credits is initially set up on your account when you subscribe.</p>
									<p>Automatic Purchasing is our option that allows you to stay in touch with the member of your preference, even when your credits run out in the middle of Live Chat or Camshare. It automatically purchases additional credits, required to continue the communication, so that your romantic conversation won't suddenly be cut off because you lack a few credits.</p><br/>
									<p><img src="img/img9.png"></p><br/>
									<p>However, you always have the option to disable it by unchecking the box "Allow Automatic Purchasing" in the "My settings and Password" menu and then by pressing the "Save" button.</p>

								<span class="faq-question">I want to call a member on her Birthday and receive 5 bonus minutes, how can I do this?</span>

									<p>Five days before your preferred member's birthday you will receive a notification in your inbox.

									<p>To place a Reservation Phone Call please go to the <a href="http://www.amolatina.com/callme.html">Call Me</a> part of the Services section.</p><br/>
									<p><img src="img/img13.png"></p><br/>
									<p>You need to select your time zone, the date and time you wish to speak with your preferred member.</p>
									<p>Please check that your local time and your time zone are set correctly before confirming your phone call.</p><br/>
									<p><img src="img/img14.png"></p><br/>
									<p><img src="img/img15.png"></p><br/>
									<p>It is also very important that you have the correct contact number indicated in the corresponding fields.</p>
									Kindly check the country code (for example, 1 for the USA, 44 for the UK etc.), your area code (3 digits only in this field) and your telephone number.  You may also indicate an additional number we will be able to connect you on in the event that the primary phone number is unreachable.</p>
									<p>Please ensure that you have at least 100 credits in your account as otherwise you will not be able to place the reservation (with the exception of a repeat call to the member of your preference that is charged 70 credits).</p>
									<p>The member's time will be set automatically depending on her location and you will be able to review it and set the most convenient time to suit you both.</p>
									<p>The system will notify you that 100 credits will be deducted from your account for the first 10 minutes. Please note that each additional minute costs 10 credits, therefore if you wish to speak with your preferred member for longer than 10 minutes, it is always a good idea to top-up before the call takes place.</p>
									<p>The member receives a notification and will have the option to accept the time you suggested or offer a new one.</p>
									<p>You will be notified in both cases- if the member accepts your time or proposes a new one. If she proposes a new one, you can only accept it or cancel the call and place a new reservation. Note, that the notifications will be send to the email you indicated in your profile.</p>
									<p>You will receive a call at the appointed time; the system will automatically connect you with your preferred member and the interpreter.</p>
									<p>If you don't see your call in the active list of the <a href="http://www.amolatina.com/callme.html">Call Me section</a> it means that it changed the status. You will be able to click on Archived Phone Calls and see the status of the call. We will be happy to look into it for you to find out exactly what changed or went wrong. Please contact our Customer Support team with your ID and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

							<!-- QUESTION -->
							<div class="faq-question-block">
								<span class="faq-question">Why can't the lady see me?</span>
								<span class="faq-answer">
									<p>One possible reason for the lack of signal from your camera is that there is another program already using your webcam while you are trying to use Camshare. Please try closing down all other programs apart from your browser and that should help.</p>
									<p>Please, be aware that our Camshare service requires a high-speed internet connection on both yours and the member's end in order for you to see her large, HD video feed. If the member does not have a stable internet connection, she may not be able to see your video. We recommend trying later when the connection will be more stable.</p>
									<p>Please also check that you have the latest version of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html">Adobe Flash Player</a> as this is required for all our video-related services.</p>
									<p>Please make sure your camera is not being used by any other program, such as Skype as there is a flash feature that prevents multiple applications from accessing your webcam simultaneously. Please completely shut down any other applications that employ your webcam before attempting your next Camshare.</p>
									<p>As well as the aforementioned software requirements, please ensure you camera is powered on and that you have enabled your video feed by clicking on the camera button at the bottom of the chat window. If you do not see this 'allow' button then, please, change your screen resolution to a number higher than 900. Find instructions <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Screen-Resolution-on-a-PC">here</a></p>
									<p>It is also important to make a distinction between Live Chat with video and Camshare. All your current sessions in Live Chat have to be shut down before starting a Camshare, these are two different services and cannot run side by side.</p>

								<span class="faq-question">How do I know the members on AnastasiaDate are real people and how does AnastasiaDate vouch for them?</span>
								<span class="faq-answer">
									<p>AmoLatina employs a dedicated verification team that works hard to provide confirmed and updated information on each member, and regularly verifies their identities in order to avoid outdated information or any possible fraud.</p>
									<p>The AmoLatina verification team checks each member's correspondence and immediately addresses any question of incorrect use of the AmoLatina mailing system. AmoLatina also incorporates an Anti-Scam Policy, a policy which leads the fight against scammers and online fraud.</p>
									<p>The sincerity and honesty of the members is also ascertained by selective letter screening and regular personal interviews with each member.</p>
									<p>You still have several opportunities to make sure you are talking to your selected member. Camshare and Live Chat with video give you peace of mind you require if any doubt arises.</p>
